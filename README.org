*** Disclaimer
It's not really suited to be used for public, since there's a nicer tool called
~archinstall~. I made this script as a tool that suits my needs and deploys
the OS with my setup and configs. Also it's a part of learning howto's.
Though I hope somebody find in here something helpfull.

* So
A simple script for automated installation of Arch Linux.

This script basically follows the official Installation Guide from ArchWiki
but with some additions.

It can install Arch with GRUB/Unified kernel image and with non-encrypted or
encrypted root partition /(dm-crypt with LUKS)/

* Installation
Most likely Arch image doesn't ship ~git~ so it needs to be installed first.
#+begin_src bash
pacman -Sy git
#+end_src
Then clone the repository

* Usage
#+begin_src bash
./arch-deploy.bash --help
#+end_src

* TODO TODOs
  - [ ] Auto-mounting on choosing the boot stage
  - [ ] Auto-figure swap size
